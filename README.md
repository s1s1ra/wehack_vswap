### We_SWAP

## Inspiration

In order to build a welcoming community where everyone feels included, so that they may develop and flourish, we must treat one another with respect, dignity, and empathy. Every one of us has a duty to model inclusive behaviour in all of our interactions, whether they be at work, school, or in the community. We need to collaborate with others, to improve our immediate environment. Our proposed solution to tackle the problem is a web based application that supports these objectives by promoting perception, diversity and involvement.

## What it does

What other better way to know and understand about cultural diversity than living it yourself! Our application helps you meet new/known people who share your interests, or whose life you would like to experience for a day! You can form a crew to invite people to your religious/cultural events or even sign up to attend someone else's event. 
 
## How we built it

We started with building up the Domain model followed by the E-R diagram for our database. Then we started setting up the database using MySQL and implemented REST APIs in the backend to connect the database to the frontend which was implemented using React js. This was done for each feature of application. We went over several iterations of this process to include everything and made sure to link everything properly. 

## Challenges we ran into

Creating an application with ease of accessibility for everyone was the major focus of the project. Another important aspect was making sure to achieve the objective and propagate it's true purpose through the means of this application. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to materialize our sentiments and thoughts together regarding the problem statement felt like an achievement in itself.

## What we learned

Diverse and inclusive environments earn deeper trust and more commitment from their peers and others. It promotes happiness, to begin with, and a sense of belonging which flourishes greater innovation and creativity. Working on this problem statement with a diverse team group made us appreciate and comprehend all the factors and reasons even more. 

## What's next for VSWAP

Including more features such as organizing group events during culture specific festivals and including and connecting more people for the same will be the next objective. Expanding the backend features and making the site secure will be the next step after that.
